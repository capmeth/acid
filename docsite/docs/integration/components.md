title: Customizing Components
cobeMode: static

Internal ACID components have their own documentation pages here in this docsite, as we use ACID to document ACID, of course.  The *custom* components can be customized (read: replaced) as necessary.


# Configuring A Replacement Component

When replacing a component, it is probably best to start with the existing version of the one you wish to customize.  The [ACID repo][repo] is public, so you can download or cut & paste code from there.

Once you have created your custom component, you can use it to replace a default one using the `config.components` option.

For example, if you have a custom component at *src/components/Tag.svelte* (relative to the root of your project), you can replace the existing **Tag** component:

```js
components:
{
    'main/Tag': 'src/components/Tag',
    ...
}
```

Look for the *cid* tag on a custom component to get the id to use for replacing a component.

All of the custom components also support CSS injection (see the [styling docs](section/styling) page), so you can create custom injectables for them as needed.


# Customizing Components

Custom components will generally have an expected interface (props) that should be supported, as other internal components make use of them.  So be sure to handle at least the required props for the component you are replacing to be sure you are implementing what's necessary for a functioning docsite.

See the [Stable](section/comps_stable) and [Custom](section/comps_custom) component sections for all the available components with their individual documentation.


## Data Objects

Just about everything in the docsite UI is centered around two main types of data objects - *section* and *asset*.

An overview of these two objects is below.  Check the [Component API Reference](document/reference-component-api) page for more details.


# The `section` Object

A section object is identified by its `name`, which corresponds to the name given to it in `config.sections`.

A section object will have all the information about a section, including its title, a list of its assets (if any), the name of its parent section (if not the root) and a list of any child sections it may have.  It will also have a markdown content id there is `overview` content specified.


# The `asset` Object

An asset object is identified by its `uid`, which is generated by `config.toAssetId` at build time.  A UID is an identifier that is unique across all asset types.

The object will have all the details about an asset, including its title (name), the type of asset, the name of the section it belongs to, and a list of any tags attached.  It will also have a markdown content id if there is a document associated with it (always the case with document assets).

An asset object will have additional properties available specific to the asset type.


## Docsite Build

Your custom components, as well as anything they depend on, will be pulled into the docsite build when generating the site.  

The build process compiles components in *runes* mode and will make all of the typical Svelte libraries available.  It is equipped to handle *.js*, *.json*, and *.css* files, as well as svelte files with *.svelte* or *.svt* extensions.  It can also process CommonJs modules.  If your custom component requires anything fancier than this you may need to generate a separate bundle first before integrating your components into the docsite.  The build's output format is ESM.


## Importing Components

The docsite build also maps stable and custom components via special module specifier prefixes.

```svelte
<script module>
import Button from '#stable/helper/Button'
import Markup from '#custom/main/Markup'
</script>
```

Just prefix a component's *cid* with `#stable/` or `#custom/` to import it.  The build will resolve file extensions for you so it is not necessary to include them.

Module specifiers are remapped when replacing a component.  For instance, if you have replaced the **Markup** component in the above example then your custom implementation will be the one imported, not the original.

Any component that supports CSS injection will have the `inject` tag attached that identifies the ID used to inject CSS into that cmoponent (see the [docsite styling](section/styling) page).


## APIs

The `#public` module specifier can be used to get at the docsite APIs.

```svelte
<script module>
import { ainfo, page, sinfo, site } from '#public'
</script>
```

The `ainfo` and `sinfo` functions are used to get asset and section objects from their UIDs and names, respectively.  They also include additional functionality pertaining to the entity access they facilitate.  

Use `site` to access available configuration info as well as generate docsite URLs.  The `page` import includes a function to set html `<title>` for the page.

See the [Component API Reference](document/reference-component-api) page for more details.
