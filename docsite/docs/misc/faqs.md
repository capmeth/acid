Questions are most welcome.  This project is actively maintained and I especially seek to make sure this documentation is as accurate, informative, and easy to navigate as possible.  

This FAQ is intended to be derived from questions asked on the [issues page](https://github.com/capmeth/acid/issues).  Please check below and over there to see if your question has already been asked & answered.  Of course, the docs will be updated directly if it becomes apparent that it is confusing or lacking on a given topic.

So... if there is anything about ACID you are not quite grasping, please head over to the aforementioned issues page, click the "New Issue" button and ask your question.  Please be sure to add the **question** label to your post.
