These are the components used internally by ACID.  

HTML and CSS class structure is presented in the example area for each component.  This information can be used to edit CSS or build themes for a site.

The root component, **Docsite**, is split into multiple regions:

- **banner**: docsite header
- **leader**: a header for the page
- **main**: main content for the page
- **trailer**: a footer for the page
- **nav**: primary navigation for the page
- **footer**: docsite footer

The middle four regions above are filled by individual *Page Components*.

In the structural docs for the components, the current region is represented by `{region}`.
