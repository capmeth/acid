title: Shared Components
---

Shared components provide built-in functionality for **custom** components.  

They cannot be replaced, but some of them can be themed.  These components are used by **core** components and are accessible for use in **custom** components as well.

Components here that can be re-styled will have the *inject* tag attached, and that tag will identify the ID used in the stylesheet to associate styling with the component.
