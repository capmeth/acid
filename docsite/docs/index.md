# Introducing...

Another Component Interface Documenter (ACID) is a highly configurable and easy to use platform for generating UI component documentation sites (docsites).  Docsite generation is not tied to any framework or build system, and with extensions assets from any component framework can be documented.

Some features of ACID include:

- **Live Code Editing!**  
  Edit example code in the browser and immediately see results.
- **Syntax Highlighting!**  
  Syntax highlighting in code examples.
- **Component Framework Agnostic!**  
  Document components built on any framework (with extensions).
- **Component Filtering!**  
  Filter components in the library using asset tags.
- **Hot-Reload in Development!**  
  Edit document/source files and see updates in the live docsite.
- **Theme and Update Styling!**  
  Easily change styles or make a new theme.

ACID is a hobby project inspired by [react-styleguidist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-styleguidist).
