"A Component Interface Documenter" (ACID) is a highly configurable platform for generating UI component documentation sites (docsites).  Docsite generation is not tied to any component framework and does not require your project to be on any specific build system. With extensions, any type of component can be documented.

&nbsp;&nbsp; ******[Get Started >](/section/start)******

Some features of ACID include:

- ******Live Code Editing!******  
  Edit example code **in the browser** and immediately see results.

- ******Code Highlighting!******  
  Language specific **syntax highlighting** for markdown code blocks.

- ******Framework Agnostic!******  
  Document components built on **any framework** (with extensions).

- ******Hot-Reload in Development!******  
  Edit document/source files and **see live updates** in the docsite.
  
- ******Fully Customizable!******  
  Tailor your docsite by **changing the CSS** or **replacing/embedding components**.
