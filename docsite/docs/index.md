"A Component Interface Documenter" (ACID) is a highly configurable platform for generating UI component documentation sites (docsites).  Docsite generation is not tied to any component framework and does not require your project to be on any specific build system. With extensions, any type of component can be documented.

Some features of ACID include:

- ******Live Code Editing!******  
  Edit example code **in the browser** and immediately see results.
- ******Code Highlighting!******  
  Language specific **syntax highlighting** for markdown code blocks.
- ******Framework Agnostic!******  
  Document components built on **any framework** (with extensions).
- ******Component Filtering!******  
  **Quickly find documentation** in your library using tag and name filters.
- ******Hot-Reload in Development!******  
  Edit document/source files and **see live updates** in the docsite.
- ******Theming and Styling!******  
  **Full CSS control** for modifying or rewriting docsite themes.

**ACID** is a hobby project inspired by [react-styleguidist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-styleguidist).
